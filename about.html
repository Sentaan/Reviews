<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>I'm Sentaan or Adam. I'm a big fan of books, music and video games.</p>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p>I grew up reading and loving authors such as Rick Riordan (<i>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</i>), Derek Landy (<i>Skulduggery Pleasant</i>), and Philip Reeve (<i>Mortal Engines</i>). All three of these are authors I still continue to read or re-read.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
<p class="mb-5">I've been a big fan of music since I was about 11. Growing up I primarily listened to Rock and Metal, with some of my favourite bands having been Breaking Benjamin, Tonight Alive, and Bullet for My Valentine. However more recently I've been getting into K-Pop groups such as Stray Kids, ITZY and aespa.</p>

<h2>Video Games</h2>
<p>Growing up I used to play the Lego games on the Wii, upgrading to the Wii U when that was released. I also have the kick every month to play Minecraft. Some of my all time favourite games include Hades, Arkham Origins, and the Assassin Creed games.</p>

<h2>TV Series</h2>
<p>Some of my favourite TV series are Warehouse 13, SWAT, and Haikyuu. I've recently started watching K-Dramas and my favourites of the ones I have seen so far are My Name, My Demon and Nevertheless.</p>
