<h3 class="section-heading">Introduction</h3>
<p>Being the first Japanese release that ITZY have made since Algorhythm (2024), means it is the first Japanese release since Lia ended her hiatus. And, as we saw with GOLD (2024), Collector features a set of new songs along with Final Version (OT5 Versions) of the songs from Algorhythms. We also get Japanese versions of the title tracks from the last two Korean releases, GOLD, Imaginary Friend and Girls Will Be Girls. Collector is also the first ITZY release since I have started listening to them.</p>
<h3 class="section-heading">Overall Album Review</h3>
<p>All of the new songs and final versions on the album are worth listening to, the caveat with the Japanese being that I am not someone that can speak or Japanese, and as a result I have very little incentive to listen to the Japanese versions over the Korean versions.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Track by Track Review</h3>
<h4>1. ROCK & ROLL</h4>
<p>Collector starts out strong with the title track ROCK & ROLL. ROCK & ROLL is a very energetic song, which helps Collector really start with a bang. The only real criticism, and it is a pretty minor criticism, I have with ROCK & ROLL is that, although you can definitely hear guitar through, I feel as if the guitar sits too low in the mix. When hearing that the title track was called ROCK & ROLL, I was really hoping that the instrumental would be more guitar led.  The lack of presence of guitars is especially hammered home by the fact that <a href="#TriggerTrack">Trigger</a> has guitars which are prominent in the track. But the fact that the guitars are low in the mix is not such a problem that I don't enjoy ROCK & ROLL</p>
<h4>2. I. I. Know Me</h4>
<p>Following on from ROCK & ROll is I. I. Know Me. This is another strong song. I. I. Know Me definitely feels like a Ryujin's and Yuna's. The parts that stick in my head are their parts.</p>
<h4>3. Out of season</h4>
<p>Out of season is the weakest of the songs so far. It has a much more chill vibe than both ROCK & ROLL and I. I. Know, which in itself is not an issue. However, despite being the shortest track on the album, it feels repetitive. Other than the line "Out of my season" none of the lines are all that memorable. An interesting instrumentation could save a song like this, however unfortunately the instrumentation isn't that interesting. It's primarily focused around the repetitive strings, drums and bass. If the bass was doing more than just holding the root notes, I feel that could even help with making the song feel less boring.</p>
<h4 id="TriggerTrack">4. Trigger</h4>
<p>Where Out of season, was let down by its instrumentation, the instrumentation for Trigger really makes. This is despite the fact that for the majority of the song the drums are playing a very simple pattern. But it's the fact that the guitar and bass aren't just playing root notes or chords and at several parts the instrumentation changes up dramatically, with the guitar and bass dropping out and a piano taking over for the first post chorus, and later during the bridge all the instruments drop out and just a synth accompanies the vocal line.</p>
<h4>5. Wind Ride</h4>
<p>Of all the songs on Collector, Wind Ride is my least favourite. That doesn't mean it is a bad song, just Wind Ride is not a song that I would go out of my way to listen to, like I would with ROCK & ROLL, I. I. Know Me, and Trigger. And just as with Out of season, it's the instrumentation that lets Wind Ride down. While not being as simplistic as the instrumentation of Out of season, the instrumentation feels repetitive.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, I think that Collector is a strong, cohesive release from ITZY. And there are definitely songs that will appeal to everyone. It's also great to get OT5 versions for Algorhythm and No Biggie. ROCK & ROLL, I. I. Know Me, and Trigger are all songs that are going to go in my playlist.</p>
